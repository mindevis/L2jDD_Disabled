// It refers to Beast (mobs) that can be attacked but can also be fed
// For example, the Beast Farm's Alpen Buffalo.
// This class is only truly used by the handlers in order to check the correctness
// of the target.  However, no additional tasks are needed, since they are all
// handled by scripted AI.
